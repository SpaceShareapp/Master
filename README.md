This will be my initial webpage to introduce SpaceShareapp to the world. The concept of SpaceShare came about after the COVID-19 lockdown... I had been in the middle of a structural bodywork therapy trade.  The therapist I was trading with had let go of his office after a few vacant months of lockdown.  Although I knew of many therapists in the area, I was having trouble finding an office space to work in.  One question that came to my mind was "Why isn't this an app?"
